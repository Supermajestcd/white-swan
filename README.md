# White Swan Site

This site is a website for White Swan, it uses [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as a static site generator and TinaCMS(https://nextjs.org/) as a github based CMS

## Editing the site using the CMS

In the bottom left of all pages will be a small pen icon, clicking this will ask you to login to the site, and from here you will be able to edit using the Inline TinaCms editing tools. 

It should be quite straight forward by clicking on text to edit the page, click the plus button on the top left to add new pages or blog posts, and is the sidebar options to edit the navigation items.
No changes will be saved until the save button in the top right is pressed, this will trigger a new build which will take a couple of minutes, before the changes show on the live site.

## Installation

Getting started locally
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

Todo, this will be on hosted on netlify, and the form submission will be handled by them
